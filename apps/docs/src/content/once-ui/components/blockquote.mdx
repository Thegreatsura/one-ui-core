Use `BlockQuote` to present quoted text with emphasis and proper semantics. It renders a semantic `<blockquote>` element and forwards all layout and style props from `Flex`.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <BlockQuote
      author={{
        name: "Lorant",
        avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
      }}
      link={{
        href: "https://once-ui.com/blog/truth",
        label: "once-ui.com"
      }}
      subline="Building is lonely if you do it alone.">
      “If you’re going to take this path, find your people.”
    </BlockQuote>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
      avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
    }}
    link={{
      href: "https://once-ui.com/blog/truth",
      label: "once-ui.com"
    }}
    subline="Building is lonely if you do it alone.">
    “If you’re going to take this path, find your people.”
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "BlockQuote"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Content

Use the `children` prop as the quote text and display an additional `preline` or `subline`.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <BlockQuote
      preline="That’s when we realized the deeper problem."
      subline="Open your feed and you’ll see the same promises everywhere."
      author={{
        name: "Lorant",
        avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
      }}>
      “So much of the industry has shifted from solving real problems to selling shortcuts.”
    </BlockQuote>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote
    preline="That’s when we realized the deeper problem."
    subline="Open your feed and you’ll see the same promises everywhere."
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
      avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
    }}>
    “So much of the industry has shifted from solving real problems to selling shortcuts.”
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Content"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Link

Attach a citation source using the `link` attribute. This is useful for accessibility and provenance.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <BlockQuote
      author={{
        name: "Lorant",
      }}
      link={{
        href: "once-ui.com/truth",
        label: "once-ui.com"
      }}>
      “The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”
    </BlockQuote>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
    }}
    link={{
      href: "once-ui.com/truth",
      label: "once-ui.com"
    }}>
    “The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Link"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Author

Include an author line below the quote.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <BlockQuote
      author={{
        name: "Harold Abelson",
        avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
      }}>
      “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
    </BlockQuote>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
      avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
    }}>
      “No single piece guarantees success, but together, they create inevitability. Over time, people start recognizing your name, your style, your values, and your products. That recognition compounds.”
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Author"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Separators

Adjust the visibility of the separator lines by setting `top`, `bottom` or `none` to the `separator` prop.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <BlockQuote
      separator="top">
      “We weren’t interested in selling visions that fall apart the moment someone buys in. We wanted to build products that last.”
    </BlockQuote>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote separator="top">
    “We weren’t interested in selling visions that fall apart the moment someone buys in. We wanted to build products that last.”
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Separator"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Alignment

Adjust the alignment of the quote text by setting `align` to `left`, `center` or `right`.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <Column fillWidth>
      <BlockQuote
        align="left"
        separator="none"
        author={{
          name: "Lorant",
        }}
        link={{
          href: "once-ui.com/truth",
          label: "once-ui.com"
        }}>
        “The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”
      </BlockQuote>
      <BlockQuote
        align="right"
        separator="top"
        author={{
          name: "Lorant",
        }}
        link={{
          href: "once-ui.com/truth",
          label: "once-ui.com"
        }}>
        “The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”
      </BlockQuote>
    </Column>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote
    align="left"
    separator="none"
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
    }}
    link={{
      href: "once-ui.com/truth",
      label: "once-ui.com"
    }}>
    “The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”
</BlockQuote>
<BlockQuote
    align="right"
    separator="top"
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
    }}
    link={{
      href: "once-ui.com/truth",
      label: "once-ui.com"
    }}>
    “The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Alignment"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Styling

`BlockQuote` ships with a default look, but you can override appearance using any `Flex` styling props.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  preview={
    <BlockQuote 
        border="neutral-alpha-medium"
        background="surface"
        radius="xl"
        padding="l"
        align="left"
        separator="none"
        author={{
          name: "Lorant",
        }}
        link={{
          href: "once-ui.com/truth",
          label: "once-ui.com"
        }}>
        <Text variant="heading-default-l">“The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”</Text>
    </BlockQuote>
  }
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<BlockQuote 
    border="neutral-alpha-medium"
    background="surface"
    radius="xl"
    padding="l"
    align="left"
    separator="none"
    author={{
      name: "Lorant",
    }}
    link={{
      href: "once-ui.com/truth",
      label: "once-ui.com"
    }}>
    <Text variant="heading-default-l">“The first time a stranger pays for something you’ve built — something that came entirely from your mind — your worldview changes forever.”</Text>
</BlockQuote>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Styling"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility Considerations

`BlockQuote` renders a semantic `<blockquote>` element to convey quoted content to assistive technologies. Provide a `link` URL when available to reference the source. Ensure sufficient color contrast if you override the default `background` or `onBackground` props.
